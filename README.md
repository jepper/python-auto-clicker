# python-auto-clicker
A simple mouse button auto clicker for games

Install Python, ensure you tick the box to update your Windows
PATH. For what it's worth, the audience here is kids, Windows
gaming PCs, so forgive me the non Linux/Mac bias.

Then open a command prompt and 

pip install -r requirements.txt

And finally copy the autoclicker.py to your desktop for ease
of access.

The [ key will toggle clicking on and off.

The click frequency can be modified by altering the delay
variable. Lesser delay means more clicks per second.

We could obviuosly make this a lot easier, but once
installed it just works.
